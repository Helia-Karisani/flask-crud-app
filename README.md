## Flask CRUD App – Financial Transaction Manager

This is a simple web application built with **Flask** that performs basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a list of financial transactions.

It was developed as part of a hands-on lab to practice routing, request handling, and HTML rendering using Flask.

---

### Features

* **Create** new transactions with date and amount
* **Read** and view all transactions in a tabular list
* **Update** any existing transaction
* **Delete** transactions (using POST for safety)
* Clean and styled frontend using Bootstrap
* No database — data is stored in memory (list of dictionaries)

---

### Pages

* `/` – View all transactions (Transaction Records)
* `/add` – Add a new transaction
* `/edit/<id>` – Edit an existing transaction
* `/delete/<id>` – Delete a transaction (via POST)

* Make sure to use `POST` (not `GET`) for deletion to follow proper web practices.
